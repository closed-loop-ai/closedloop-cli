## üéØ The Problem You're Solving

**Product teams are drowning in scattered product feedback** from multiple channels:
- Support tickets scattered across Zendesk, Intercom, and email
- Sales and customer success call insights buried in transcripts  
- User surveys and feedback forms in different tools
- Social media mentions and app store reviews
- Internal team discussions in Slack

**The result?** Critical customer product feedback get lost, patterns go unnoticed, and product decisions are made without data.

## ‚ú® How ClosedLoop AI CLI Solves This

**Transform chaos into clarity** with autonomous AI that:

- üîç **Discovers Hidden Patterns** - AI finds insights humans would miss across all your feedback sources
- ‚ö° **Real-Time Analysis** - Get instant insights as new customer product feedback comes in
- üìä **Strategic Intelligence** - Convert customer voice into actionable product decisions
- üéØ **Revenue Impact** - Quantify the business value of each customer feedback
- üîÑ **Source Agnostic** - Works with any data source through flexible APIs

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install globally for CLI usage
npm install -g @closedloop-ai/cli
```

### Get Your API Key

1. Visit [https://closedloop.sh](https://closedloop.sh)
2. Sign up for a free account (100,000 credits every month included!)
3. Generate your API key
4. Configure the CLI:

```bash
cl config set --api-key your-api-key-here
```

### Set Your Product Website (Important!)

Configure your product's website URL to help ClosedLoop understand your product context:

```bash
cl team website "https://yourproduct.com/feature"
```

**Why this matters:** ClosedLoop AI uses your product URL to learn about your product features, competitors, pricing, and positioning. This enables more accurate feedback attribution and product-specific insights. For example, if you're working on iPhone, use `https://apple.com/iphone` - this helps ClosedLoop AI understand that "camera quality" feedback is about iPhone cameras, not just any camera.

### Submit Your First Customer Feedback

```bash
# Submit raw customer feedback for AI analysis
cl input "The new dashboard is confusing and hard to navigate. I can't find the settings menu and the layout is cluttered."

# Wait for AI to analyze and generate structured insights
cl input "Customer complaint about performance issues" --wait

# View all AI-generated customer product feedback
cl feedback

# Get detailed analysis of a specific insight
cl feedback 2ea8f556-052b-4f5c-bf86-833780b3d00d
```

## üìñ CLI Commands

### Submit Customer Feedback

```bash
# Basic submission
cl input "The app crashes when I try to upload large files"

# With metadata for better analysis
cl input "Great product, love the new features!" \
  --title "Positive Feedback" \
  --customer "customer-456" \
  --name "Jane Smith" \
  --email "jane@example.com" \
  --url "https://support.example.com/ticket/789"

# Wait for AI analysis to complete
cl input "Customer complaint about performance" --wait
```

### View AI-Generated Customer Product Feedback

```bash
# List all structured insights
cl feedback

# View specific insight details
cl feedback <insight-id>

# Get JSON output for scripting
cl feedback --json | jq '.data[0].title'
```

### Manage Your Data

```bash
# List all customer feedback submitted
cl input

# View specific feedback details
cl input <feedback-id>

# Check processing status
cl input <feedback-id> --status
```

## üîß Configuration

The CLI stores configuration in `~/.closedloop/config.json`:

```json
{
  "apiKey": "your-api-key-here"
}
```

### Environment Variables (Advanced)

**For developers and CI/CD systems**, you can also set your API key as an environment variable instead of using the config file:

```bash
# Set the API key as an environment variable
export CLOSEDLOOP_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Now you can use the CLI without running 'cl config set'
cl input "Customer feedback here"
```

**When to use this:**
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Set the API key in your deployment environment
- **Docker containers**: Pass the API key as an environment variable
- **Server scripts**: When running automated scripts on servers
- **Multiple users**: When different users need different API keys on the same machine

**Note:** The CLI will automatically use the environment variable if it's set, otherwise it falls back to the config file.

## üí° Simple Workflow

Here's how to get started with ClosedLoop AI CLI:

```bash
# 1. Set your API key
cl config set --api-key your-api-key-here

# 2. Set your product website (helps AI understand your product)
cl team website "https://yourproduct.com/feature"

# 3. Submit customer feedback
cl input "The new dashboard is confusing and hard to navigate"

# 4. Check what feedback you've submitted
cl input

# 5. View AI analysis of your feedback
cl feedback

# 6. Get details on specific feedback
cl feedback <feedback-id>
```

That's it! ClosedLoop AI will automatically analyze your feedback and provide actionable insights.
